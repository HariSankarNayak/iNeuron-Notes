    "description": "Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are computer systems that are modelled after the biological neural networks that make up animal brains. It processes data and creates patterns for use in decision-making in the same way that the human brain does. Using the most up-to-date frameworks, you'll learn Artificial neural networks, Transfer Learning, and more.",
